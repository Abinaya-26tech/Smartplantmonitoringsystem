# Smart plant monitoring system
Description : 
When power ON  this  system  , the  Node MCU board connects to the Blynk app using the internet 

and Blynk cloud . 
 
Then the soil moisture is displayed on the Blynk app interface .

Also with the button created in the Blynk app ,we can turn the relay module ON and  OFF.

Using the DHT11 , We can analyse the temperature and humidity of the plant value.

So , by the WIFI module we can connect to our phone and identify the soil moisture ,
 
Temperature and humidity values. If the moisture content is low , we can ON the water by the motor 

pump water will be generated and provide sufficient amount of water.

Here , i attach the code used in the Arduino uno and WIFI module which is used mainly in this

 working of the project .
